        <p>And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye
                will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not
                suffer that thebbeggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</p>

            <p>And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people. And now, my son,
                go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto
                repentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them. And may God grant
                unto you even according to my words. Amen.</p>
